# ![Screenshot](resources/img/HopReveal.png) Hop Reveal plugin for Craft CMS 3.x

Hop Reveal gives site editors a quick and helpful visual cue to which server they are working on -- staging, development or production -- on both front-end and back-end website pages. (Surely we aren't the only ones who sometimes get mixed up!) Choose the text and color of the labels yourself. You can even make the labels visible to all users if you desire. 

This plugin also provides a handy utilities page where you can view key environment variables useful during development. Some of the many variables included are GATEWAY_INTERFACE, HTTP_ACCEPT, HTTP_COOKIE, HTTP_USER_AGENT, and that's just for starters.

Get important information faster when you use Hop Reveal for Craft CMS.
